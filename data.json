On my free time, I like learning new things. I am mostly a backend developer but I was always curious about front-end. I applied to Treehouse Full-stack Javascript Development course to learn more about web application development. This portfolio is to showcase the several projects that I did in the course. Doing them had been a very fun experience. Please feel free to look around!",
